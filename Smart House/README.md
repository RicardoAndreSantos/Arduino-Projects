# Work developed for Embedded Systems course

The goal is to build a smart house, capable of detecting movement within a room, get temperature readings and light intensity.
It should still be possible to change the state of a light through an android app, as well as choose the 'autonomous home' option.

### Functional Requirements
- [x] Turn on the light if someone enters a room
- [x] Turn off the light if someone leaves a room
- [x] Change each light status with the android app
- [x] Get temperature values
- [x] Get light intensity values
- [x] Turn on the house lights in case the light intensity is lower than a certain threshold
